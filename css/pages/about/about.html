            <h1>Chickens!</h1>
            <p>
                Chickens have had a long and impactful role in history. This is mainly because chickens are an easy source of eggs and meat. Chickens have been part of many cultures and traditions throughout time. The ancient Romans had roosters fight each other while ancient Greece chickens were found as an attribute to some of their gods like Ares, Heracles, and Athena. Around 10,000 years ago the first Red Junglefowl was domesticated. After their domestication chickens traveled the world starting from Southeast Asia all the way to the New World. A few hundred years later you can now commonly find chickens at your local Costco at the back of the store freshly grilled and seasoned. 	Prior to being considered relatively cheap meals to pick up on a run to Costco chickens were seen differently. The legend behind Chinese zodiac signs is an interesting tale of a race. The race would decide what 12 animals would be zodiacs. During the race the rooster, the monkey and the sheep all worked together to get to the finish line. Many of the other animals in the race betrayed or used each other but the chicken stuck with its friends and helped them along the way, even if it meant that they would not be one of the 12 Zodiacs. Now the Chinese Zodiac Rooster is defined as loyal, adventurous, charitable, funny, argumentative, boastful, and at times self-involved.
                In the year of the Rooster, 2005, I was born. 13 years later, I got chickens. It had just turned Spring after a long and very cold winter, so when I remembered that my mother said I could pick out some baby chicks I held her to it and headed directly to the IFA Country Store. This was a huge deal because the only animals I had ever been allowed were traditional pets like cats and dogs and a few goldfish throughout the years. In order to prepare to raise my new chicks my siblings and I carefully prepared a box full of hay, food and water. It took a while but I eventually learned how to care for my chickens. My dog was not very fond of my chickens at first, he would try and attack them. One day my dog got outside when the chickens were free roaming, one of the chickens was able to lead him away from the others and I was able to get to her before anything could happen. The chicken sacrificed herself for the wellbeing of the flock. Fast forward to today where I continue to raise my chickens and  am better for it.
                In my life chickens have taught me a lot, especially about loyalty. To understand what loyalty is one might search the web. The first definition to pop up says that loyalty is a strong feeling of support or allegiance. Dictionary.com thinks that loyalty is commitment, respect and support. On the other hand ColinsDictionary.com explains that loyalty is staying firm in a relationship. All of these text-book definitions of loyalty are great if you are looking for a quick explanation of the word, but it isn't enough. Instead of looking at an online dictionary, turn your focus instead to history. Great leaders of even greater civilizations have fallen because of the lack of loyalty and other civilizations grew and prospered because of loyalty. Countless soldiers loyal to their king, queens and kingdoms have fallen in epic battles. Soldiers have shown allegiance to their leaders, are strong, brave, and have helped the needy. We can learn something about loyalty from them, can't we? While it is true that soldiers are determined foot-men eager to protect their countries no matter what happens to them, even they are not the best way to describe loyalty. Now, I turn your attention to Chickens.
                Throughout time chickens, for some reason, have been considered loyal animals. The ancient Greeks, the Chinese, even the modern day Costco shopper have considered them to be loyal animals (Even if just for a meal). I strongly believe that this is not a coincidence. Chickens are affectionate smart animals capable of forming special bonds with their owners. Look up any video of a chicken and you will see that they are protective of their loved ones, capable of making people laugh, and caring for their own but also others. There are videos of chickens forming loving bonds with pigs and videos of chickens learning the piano or other tricks. This amazing animal has shown all of the text-book actions of being loyal and more! This is because chickens have shown constant friendship in their relationship to people. To know what loyalty is you must first know what a chicken is: kind, supportive, dependable, charitable, able to put your needs before its own, willing to put their life on the line, and most importantly are a friend to all. Dogs might be man's best friend but chickens are humanity's most loyal friend.
